# Summarise the indications of individuals in a drug cohort

Summarise the observed indications of patients in a drug cohort based on
their presence in an indication cohort in a specified time window. If an
individual is not in one of the indication cohorts, they will be
considered to have an unknown indication if they are present in one of
the specified OMOP CDM clinical tables. Otherwise, if they are neither
in an indication cohort or a clinical table they will be considered as
having no observed indication.

## Usage

``` r
summariseIndication(
  cohort,
  strata = list(),
  indicationCohortName,
  cohortId = NULL,
  indicationCohortId = NULL,
  indicationWindow = list(c(0, 0)),
  unknownIndicationTable = NULL,
  indexDate = "cohort_start_date",
  mutuallyExclusive = TRUE,
  censorDate = NULL,
  inObservation = TRUE,
  restrictIncident = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- cohort:

  A cohort_table object.

- strata:

  A list of variables to stratify results. These variables must have
  been added as additional columns in the cohort table.

- indicationCohortName:

  Name of the cohort table containing potential indications.

- cohortId:

  A cohort definition id to restrict by. If NULL, all cohorts will be
  included.

- indicationCohortId:

  Cohort definition IDs of the indications of interest. If `NULL`, all
  cohorts in `indicationCohortName` are included.

- indicationWindow:

  Time windows over which to identify indications.

- unknownIndicationTable:

  Tables in the OMOP CDM to search for unknown indications.

- indexDate:

  Name of a column that indicates the date to start the analysis.

- mutuallyExclusive:

  Whether intersections should be mutually exclusive. If `TRUE`, cohort
  combinations are reported as mutually exclusive categories; if
  `FALSE`, each cohort is reported independently.

- censorDate:

  Name of a column that indicates the date to stop the analysis, if NULL
  end of individuals observation is used.

- inObservation:

  Whether to restrict the analysis to individuals in observation. If
  `TRUE`, individuals not in observation are excluded. If `FALSE`, they
  are included as a separate category.

- restrictIncident:

  Whether to include only target cohort records that start during the
  analysis period. If FALSE, all target cohort records that overlap with
  the study period will be included.

## Value

A summarised result
